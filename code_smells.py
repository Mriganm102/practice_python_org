print(“Long Functions”)
print(“Long functions make code less readable. Functions should be focused on one task, so when it gets longer, it becomes more complex and harder to maintain”)

print(“Duplicated Code”)
print(“If a feature of the code changes, then the programmer will have to change the same piece of code twice, which is a nuisance. Not duplicating will keep code clean.”)

print(“Long Parameter List”)
print(“This increases the risk of bugs and lowers the readability. Having so many parameters can also be confusing”)


print(“To many comments”)
print(“Too many comments can be a distraction and create confusion. Having good names and clear code will lower the amount of comments.”)


print(“Global Data”)
print(“Having global variables in code can alter the code, and switch its behavior. It’s better to find a different option than using global variables.”)

print(“Mysterious Names”)
print(“Properly naming code cleans the code. There is more descriptive code, it reduces the usage of comments, and helps out other developers”)


print(“Lazy elements”)
print(“Writing code that was never used. Always delete this code”)

print(“Loops”)
print(“There are better pieces of code that help recognize code on first sight, like map and filter”)

print(“Large Classes”)
print(“Having large classes lead to duplicated code, which is not good. Take long methods and split them into smaller methods, avoid repetition.”)

print(“Temporary Field”)
print(“Code that is only in a specific field. It is bad since you need that code in the whole object”)
